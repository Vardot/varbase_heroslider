# Varbase Heroslider
---

This app will populate the universal implementation of a "Hero Slider" to be
 used on the homepage in most cases.

A rich hero slider that allows you to display video and/or image slides.

Now you can install Varbase Heroslider with any Drupal 10 sites. Even
 if installed with the Minimal or Standard profile.

However, using it with Varbase distro and Vartheme or Bootstrap theme gives
 you way much more cool stuff!


### Features
* A full-width responsive Hero Slider.
* Easy to customize slides to act as a promotional feature typically
  displayed in the site's homepage.
* Queued Herosliders.
